# 🤖 GenAI Projects

Welcome to my GenAI (Generative AI) project hub!  
This repository is where I build and experiment with generative AI applications using Large Language Models (LLMs), including OpenAI, Hugging Face models, and many more.

## 🧠 About

Generative AI is transforming how we interact with technology — from intelligent chatbots to creative content generators.  
This repo is my personal learning ground to explore different use cases, tools, and architectures in the GenAI ecosystem.
